# Calculator-Software

"I've developed a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML sets up the structure, CSS styles the interface, and JavaScript handles the functionality, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It's a practical project that showcases my understanding of front-end web development fundamentals."
